# Getting Started

## Introduction
In this exercise you will define a group ID that you will need in the course of this workshop to uniquely identify your repository artefacts and separate them from those of other users conducting the same workshop on this system.

Furthermore you will create a development package that will contain all your artefacts.

Please note that ADT dialogs and views as well as Fiori UIs may change in upcoming releases.
